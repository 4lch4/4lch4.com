Doppler CLI installed locally and authenticated (doppler login). Created a Doppler Project for your application Launch Configuration Update your existing launch configuration by creating or setting runtimeExecutable to doppler and runtimeArgs to include the command for running your application.</description></item><item><title>Doppler Integrations</title><link>https://4lch4.com/notes/infrastructure/secrets/integrations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4lch4.com/notes/infrastructure/secrets/integrations/</guid><description> Doppler Integrations &amp;ldquo;Doppler connects to a growing list of providers to keep your secrets in sync wherever you develop and deploy.&amp;rdquo; This note provides information on the integrations that are relevant to my infrastructure/use-case(s).

Doppler provides the Secrets Download API however, if you&amp;rsquo;re using NodeJS then you can make use of their gitops-secrets library to do this a bit easier.
NOTE: Doppler has plans to publish an official SDK for Node, Go, and PHP, but when it will be available has not been shared, so this is the only method for the time being.</description></item></channel></rss>
