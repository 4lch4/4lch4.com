Policy: https://www.troyhunt.com/beg-bounties/

# The following is from TroyHunt but I couldn't agree more and follow the same policy across
# my projects.

# Don't even think about contacting me for a beg bounty! No, it's not a typo, read on...
#
# I run this site for free and rely on community goodwill. By all means, if you find an *actual*
# security vulnerability then contact me and tell me what it is. If you'd like, encrypt your
# message using the key from my Keybase account listed above. But if you've just run some
# automated tooling, found something trivial then reached out with the expectation of cashing in,
# you're going to be disappointed. Read more in the policy above.
