Heyo, my name is Devin but I go by 4lch4 online (_Pronounced Al-Kuh_). I was introduced to programming when I started high school and realized while I wasn't the best at it, I really enjoyed doing it. That was 2009 and I still find myself loving software development, programming, whatever you wanna call it.

These days I work full time as a Sr. Operations Engineer at J.B. Hunt where I usually develop & support software & infrastructure to help operations run as smoothly as possible.

<!-- So, I took every class possible with him while in high school to learn as much as possible before graduation. After graduating, I moved to Arkansas to attend the [University of Arkansas at Fort Smith][1] and major in **Information Technology - Programming**.

Once I got my degree I moved to the Bay Area in Northern California and got a job in Napa Valley as a Jr. Software Test Engineer. -->
