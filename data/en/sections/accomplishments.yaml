  - name: Migrated all of J.B. Hunt cloud infrastructure from Azure to Google Cloud.
    courseOverview: |
      I was on the team that was responsible for planning and performing the
      actual migration of our resources. We managed to complete the migration
      the fastest Google had seen for an organization of our size.

  - name: Won the E&T-Focused award for the J.B. Hunt Hackathon 2 years in a row.
    courseOverview: |
      J.B. Hunt hosts a Hackathon each year and I won the E&T Focused award in
      2020 and 2021. The award went to whichever project would provide the most
      value to the Engineering and Technology department. My project was a
      status page, similar to https://statuspage.io/, that was managed by our
      Incident Management Team. When I won the 2nd time, I was able to present
      the project to the CIO who then granted us funding to finish the project
      and deploy it to production.

  - name: Created an Android version of iPowerShell Pro from SAPIEN Technologies, Inc.
    timeline: March 2016 — May 2017
    organization:
      name: SAPIEN Technologies, Inc.

    courseOverview: |
      A few months after I started at [SAPIEN Technologies](https://sapien.com)
      the CEO mentioned he wanted the iPowerShell Pro app that he created for
      iPhone to be ported to Android. I had never built an Android app at that
      point and the company helped me learn how to develop for Android while I
      ported the app. It was published roughly a year after I started on it and
      the cost was dropped from $5 to free as a celebration. It has sense been
      removed from both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
