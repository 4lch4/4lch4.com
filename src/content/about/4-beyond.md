As of April 2024 I'm working freelance gigs while looking for a new full-time position. I'm hoping to find something that will let me keep working in DevOps of some sort, but in reality as long as I can help with making and/or fixing things, I'm happy.

<br />

If you happen to know of a position that would suit me, please don't hesitate to reach out using any of the methods listed below.
