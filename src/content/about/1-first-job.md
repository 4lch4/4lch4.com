After getting my degree I moved to Benicia, CA and worked at [SAPIEN Technologies, Inc.][0] as a **Jr. Software Test Engineer** for a couple years. While there I was responsible for testing all new builds of [our suite of products][1], in a variety of environments, converting the company iOS app to Android, and providing support for customers via the forums & premium support tickets.

<br />

For example, for every new build of a product I would test our software on both 32 & 64-bit iterations of Windows 7, 8, 10. This was before I knew much about writing tests so I performed these tests manually using a desktop with a hard drive for each OS.

<br />

Aside from testing software and providing support to customers, I also converted the company's iOS app, [iPowerShell][2], to Android. This was my first Android app I'd ever built and I learned a boat load about Java, Android, and the Android ecosystem.
