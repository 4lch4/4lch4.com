To start off, my name is Devin Leaman and I go by 4lch4/Alcha online. I'm a Software Engineer with a focus in DevOps and backend/CLI development and a love for automation.

<br />

I started my journey into programming in 2009, when I was 14 and took a class on GIS in high school. My teacher, Mr. Shin, taught the class in an unusual way by using Visual Basic to visualize data from [ArcGIS][0]. This was my first exposure to programming, and I was hooked. I spent the next few years learning more about programming and GIS, and eventually went to college to further my education in the field.

<br />

I went to the [University of Arkansas at Fort Smith][1] and majored in **Information Technology - Programming**, learning mostly Java, COBOL, and SQL before graduating in 2015. One of my favorite memories was competing in an Acxiom Programming competition where me and a couple classmates competed against other colleges by solving problems with COBOL. We placed 2nd and it was an amazing experience where I learned to love competitive programming for the first time.
