After working for J.B. Hunt, I wanted something more DevOps focused instead of working DevOps on the side. Thankfully, one of my previous coworkers at J.B. Hunt had moved to a company called [Liatrio][0] and was able to get me an interview. I was hired on as a **DevOps Engineer/Consultant** and initially worked on the GitHub Practice team.

<br />

As part of the GitHub Practice team we were responsible for working with clients that wanted to migrate to GitHub Enterprise from other platforms. This meant migrating entire systems such as Azure DevOps, TargetProcess, etc., to GitHub Enterprise. We would also help clients with their CICD pipelines, writing new pipelines, and helping them with any issues they faced along the way.

<br />

I worked on the GitHub Practice team for a few months with a few clients before being moved to the Flywheel team, which was responsible for creating internal tools for the company that could be used for our clients. While on the Flywheel team I worked on Project Open O11y, which is where my love for the Go language began.

<br />

Open O11y is a project that aims to enable everyone to observe and improve their systems by providing a simple, easy to use, and easy to deploy observability stack. A component I was responsible for was the git provider in the Liatrio OTEL Collector . The git provider is a scraper that gathers metrics such as the amount of PRs/issues and their states, commit counts, etc., from GitHub and GitLab to be sent to something such as Prometheus and be displayed in Grafana.
