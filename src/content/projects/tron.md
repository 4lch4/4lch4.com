Tron was my first major public project that gained a lot of traction, and it taught me a _lot_ about open-source development and TypeScript/JavaScript. It was a Discord bot that provided over 100 commands, peaked with over 100,000 active users across over 2,000 servers.

The following is a copy & paste of the [README][0] from the repository:

Tron is a bot that is primarily used with Discord. It has a number of commands that make chatting a
bit more enjoyable. Such as `+hug`, `+kiss`, `+kick`, `+lick`, and much more that are listed in
the help command.
