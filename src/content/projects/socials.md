Just like with my [4lch4.blog][0] website, this website was used before I condensed everything into [4lch4.com][1].

## From the README

> This repo is the home of my socials landing page, with links to my accounts/presence online. It's a simple website created with Hugo and the Bootstrap BP Hugo Startpage theme. Instead of using the theme as is, I've created a fork where I maintain it myself.
