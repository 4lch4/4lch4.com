> The Guild-Emblem-Generator is a Node.js library written in JavaScript to convert emblem and guild objects obtained via the Battle.net API into actual images. You can convert the object into a buffer or a Canvas.

I wrote this library in early 2020 to help the Jeeves Discord Bot with some new features they were implementing. The bot was using the Battle.net API to get guild information and wanted to be able to display the guild's emblem in the bot's embeds.
