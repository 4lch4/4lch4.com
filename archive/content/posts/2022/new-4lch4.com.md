## The What

I recently recreated/rewrote my homepage on the internet, 4lch4.com. Previously, I was using some template that used NextJS and was really difficult to work with.

This new version was built with [Hugo][0] and uses [the Toha theme][1] as a base that I then expanded on with [my own fork][2].

## The Why(s)

> Why Hugo?

Because I've built a few smaller sites with it and I've found it to be the best static site generator I've ever worked with (and I've worked with a _lot_ of them).

> Why the Toha theme?

Because of two main reasons:

1. It looks really nice.
2. The codebase was really well written and extremely easy to extend.

> Why create a website at all?

- I wanted somewhere to store various notes.
- It's an easy way to highlight my skills, show what I've worked on, am working on, etc., when meeting with interacting with someone new.
