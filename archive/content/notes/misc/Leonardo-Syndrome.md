Ever heard of Leonardo Syndrome?

If you’ve read Peter Burke’s excellent book, _The Polymath_,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-1">1</a></sup> then you will have done, but if not: Leonardo Syndrome is where the drive to learn more and more results in beginning many projects but actually finishing few.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-2">2</a></sup>

It’s named ‘Leonardo Syndrome’ after Leonardo da Vinci himself. Despite being one of the most famous polymaths and creators in history - who doesn’t know about him?! - he was also somebody prone to failure.

Examples of his failures included _not_ successfully squaring the circle, multiple engineering designs that didn’t work such as a giant crossbow and a flying machine, misunderstanding several aspects of the heart,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-3">3</a></sup> and experimental painting designs that resulted in the slow degradation of a painting.

Even his first recorded commission as an independent painter - an altarpiece for the Chapel of San Bernardo in 1478 - he failed to complete, despite receiving a cash advance of 25 florins for it.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-4">4</a></sup> Many of his contemporaries noted that he failed to meet deadlines or to even finish projects, such as never finishing a commissioned equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-5"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-5">5</a></sup>

His unreliability was so consistent that that the Duke of Milan tried to get him to sign a contract confirming that he would finish the agreed work “within the stipulated period”.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-6"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-6">6</a></sup> Leonardo never signed this, and indeed in his diary in 1499 admitted that he had never finished a project for the Duke.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-7"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-7">7</a></sup> People doubted his abilities to complete projects _so much_ that they would request other artists instead of him - they would often end up calling in other artists to finish or repair his work, anyway.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-8"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-8">8</a></sup>

His reputation was one of brilliance - and failure.

He ended up short of money, moving from patron to patron - leaving a trail of frustration in his wake - yet what we remember about him now is his genius. His endless curiosity was the source of his brilliance and his success, but also the cause of his woes; it was his _hamartia_, to put it in terms of a Greek tragedy.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-9"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-9">9</a></sup>

Yet if he _had_ finished all of those commissions and followed through with his million-and-one ideas, what _wouldn’t_ he have done? To do one thing means not to do another. What would now be missing from the world, had Leonardo da Vinci slogged dutifully away at a horse statue for a duke?

Maybe that statue itself would have been something brilliant, but it certainly wouldn’t have kept him on the same course he ended up treading. That course is what eventually led him to the Mona Lisa - which in itself is unfinished, yet still a renowned work that inspires and transfixes people to this day.

None of us, I suggest, are on par with Leonardo da Vinci’s genius.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-10"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-10">10</a></sup> Many of us, however, will relate to Leonardo Syndrome. Reading about it was like a slap in the face for me; I stared at the wall for a solid thirty seconds when I got to the end of that chapter.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-11"><a href="https://thoughtfulatlas.bearblog.dev/leonardo-syndrome//#fn-11">11</a></sup>

Hopefully learning about it is the same source of reassurance for you as it was for me. Sure, maybe that level of flakiness requires that level of brilliance to compensate for it, but at least you know now that it isn’t fatal.

Instead, maybe it can lead to something brilliant.
