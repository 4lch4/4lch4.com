    summary: |
      J.B. Hunt hosts a Hackathon each year and I won the E&T Focused award in
      2020 and 2021. The award went to whichever project would provide the most
      value to the Engineering and Technology department. My project was a
      status page, similar to https://statuspage.io/, that was managed by our
      Incident Management Team. When I won the 2nd time, I was able to present
      the project to the CIO who then granted us funding to finish the project
      and deploy it to production.
